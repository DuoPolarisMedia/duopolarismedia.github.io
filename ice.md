## üìú Summary

Donald Trump promised to deport dangerous criminals out of the United States, and ICE has followed up on this promise. 3 in 4 arrests have been of illegal immigrants with criminal records, but what about the other 1 in 4? That's what we'll be exploring today.

## What was ICE's original task?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE for short) is a government organization established in 2003, tasked with enforcing laws to do with border control, customs, immigration, and trade. It has historically worked to remove criminals from the country who entered it illegally.

## Who have they been deporting?

Trump has repeatedly said that ICE is removing gang members and murderers from the country, but there is no mention of Emerson Colindres, an undocumented 19-year-old who had graduated from high school just a few days earlier. He, along with the rest of his family, immigrated to the US over a decade ago and applied for asylum. Years later, in 2023, it was denied and his family was given a final order of removal, with which they did not comply. When he turned 18, Colindres was given a schedule on which to check in with ICE and told that soon, he would have to wear an ankle monitor. On June 4, 2025, Emerson Colindres went to his scheduled ICE check-in and was taken out of the building in handcuffs, and his friends may never see him again. 
Tricia McLaughlin justified this with the statement:
> "if you are in the country illegally and a judge has ordered you to be removed, that is precisely what will happen."
However, a popular sentiment is that Colindres and his family are not the sort of people the the Trump administration should be targeting, as none of them had a criminal record.
